# How machine learning can be used to solve plant biology problems

## Workshop information

### What this is about

More and more data are available in plant science that have fueled ground breaking discoveries. Beyond the original intents of the experiments, these data can be used to discover even more. This is where machine learning come in - using computers to learn from data and generate models that can predict a biological phenomenon of interest - e.g. will this gene be lethal when it is knocked-out, or which genetic variants can meaningfully predict a phenotype of interests. Specifically, this workshop will touch on the following topics: What is machine learning and why is it useful? How does machine learning work? What are some example machine learning applications in plant science? How can we feed data into machine learning tools to make discoveries? What are the best practices when doing machine learning? Where to go to learn more? The workshop will include presentations, discussions, and a short hand-on section using online machine learning resources.

### When and where

* 3:30-4:30pm, 7/29/2020
* PlantBiology 2020 Worldwide Summit - Online
* [Event link](https://www.eventscribe.com/2020/ASPB/fsPopup.asp?Mode=presInfo&PresentationID=742105)

### Who the instructors are

* Shin-Han Shiu: Professor, Departments of Plant Biology and Comp. Math., Sci., & Engr., Michigan State University
* Serena Lotreck: Graduate student, Department of Plant Biology and Comp. Math., Sci., & Engr., Michigan State University

## Workshop materials

There are two main documents:
1. [Workshop presentation slides]()
2. [Workshop jupyter notebook]()

## Instructions for runnning the notebook

* Developed by Christina Azodi for the [2019 workshop](https://github.com/azodichr/ML-Pipeline/tree/master/Workshop).
* Modified for the 2020 workshop by Shinhan Shiu.

### What's needed

The workshop example is provided as a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html). It is a document generated by the [Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook applications](](https://jupyter.org/install.html)). A notebook can contain both computer codes in popular languages such as Python and R, and texts in the form of paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc.

To follow what we have shown in the workshop, you need the following:
* Git: for you to "clone" this repository to your computer to play with.
* Jupyter Lab: the application to view, edit, and execute codes in the notebook.
* Scikit-Learn and others: the software packages Jupyter Lab relies on to run the codes.

### Install Git and clone ml_workshop

[Github](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for version control (i.e., keep track of updates to codes) and collaboration (i.e., many people can work on the same codes). We have put the workshop materials 

1. Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)
2. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
3. [Configure](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) Git in your terminal
4. Clone the [ML-Pipeline](https://github.com/ShiuLab/ML-Pipeline):
```
git clone git@github.com:ShiuLab/ML-Pipeline.git
```


### Install Anaconda and ML-Pipeline dependence packages
1. Download the newest version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (python 3).
2. Install Anaconda using the instructions on their webpage.
3. Install conda extension for jupyter (this gives you the conda tab in the Jupyter Notebook page):
```
conda install nb_conda
```
4. Open terminal and make a conda environment with all of the packages you will need for the ML pipeline using the following commands:
```
conda create -n ML_Pipeline numpy pandas scikit-learn scipy matplotlib biopython nb_conda
conda activate ML_Pipeline
```

## Navigate to ML-Pipeline tutorial 
1. Fire up Jupyter (pre-installed in anaconda) from the command line by typing:
```
jupyter notebook
```
2. In the window that opens, navigate to GitHub/ML_Pipeline/Tutorial and open ML_Pipeline_tutorial.ipynb
